Product of everything except current
Write a function that takes as input two integer arrays of length len, input and index, and generates a third array, result, such that:
result[i] = product of everything in input except input[index[i]] 
Specifically:
void everythingExcept(int len,                // in parameters
                      int *input, int *index,
                      int *result             // out parameter
                     );
For instance, if the function is called with len=4, input={2,3,4,5}, and index={1,3,2,0}, then result will be set to {40,24,30,60}.
IMPORTANT: Your algorithm must run in linear time.
If you would like to implement the solution in C#, consider the following signature:
public int[] everythingExcept(int[] input, int[] index);
